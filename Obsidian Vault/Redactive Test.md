7 years imprisonment
1) What did you do ? Funny, fictionnal
2) What's the strategy to get by while inside prison : What personality trait will help you make all allies and survive


3 years in prison so far.. How the time flows fast and slow at the same time..
You've just been here for a day, so I'll walk you through how this prison works kiddo. 
First, get by silently. Don't talk with the gangs and they won't talk to you, simple. That's how I survived for the first few months, but next you'll need comfort once your routine is set in your bones. Something to make you less bored of your time in here. So try and smuggle small things that make you happy for some time, then despair once again.
I used all my skills to get by, as should you. I used my network, my learnt abilities to stay out of trouble and live as comfortably as possible in this hole. I can avoid danger because I also built a network in here. Be nice with the guards, and hopefully they'll let you have a bit more rope on your leash. Don't think twice about the modern-times slavery happening in this prison of the nation of freedom, just do it and never utter a word about it.
> What did I do to get in here ?

I helped pregnant teens get abortion. Crazy eh ?
