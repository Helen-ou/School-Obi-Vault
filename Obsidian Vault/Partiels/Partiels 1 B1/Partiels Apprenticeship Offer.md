###### AmazonUK Apprenticeship

> Studied in Cyber fields at Guardia
> Looking for Apprenticeship for third year at Guardia cybersecurity school ; looking for apprenticeship that will last until the end of my studies at Amazon.

Who am I ?
> I am a future 3rd year cybersecurity student looking for a position in an apprenticeship. I have autodidact abilities that allowed me to learn more than my curriculum taught. I for example learnt the elixir programming language and have had extensive usage of python and reverse-engineering for personal projects.  

Why am I better candidate ?
> Drive for learning cybersecurity because of passion. I want to learn everything about the subject, which would be great at such a renowned company as Amazon. Furthermore, because the school I've studied at is project based, I have had the opportunity to learn by doing accurate real world experiences in a simulated environment. This is why I am a perfect fit for an apprenticeship : My experiences have allowed me to already be prepared to become a future expert in cybersecurity. 

What are my strengths and weaknesses ? 
> Strength :
> 	I have a great time management skill that allows me to deliver quality projects in time. It also allows me to learn the most important then the lesser important in a top-to-down way.
> 	
> Weaknesses :
> 	I can sometimes be too critical of my own work, but it stems from my commitment to excellence. I've learned to channel that criticism in a constructive way and see opportunities for improvement rather than just mistakes
